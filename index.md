        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am dedicated and detail oriented. As a Software Engineering student at BYU-Idaho, I am actively seeking opportunities in that field. I currently work as a student mentor at a residential treatment center where I support clients to achieve their therapeutic goals and improve their lives. I enjoy working with others to solve problems and create new ideas. I am persistent in learning new subjects and applying new concepts.</p>
